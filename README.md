This Python script automates the process of downloading and renaming scanned mails from the ESP-xxxx WOISA portal.

xxxx is usually the name of the domiciliary company you have subscribed to.

For security purpose, you will need to login manually on the website as usual in your browser.
Then, find your session cookie, paste it in the `config.ini` and you are ready to save hours!
